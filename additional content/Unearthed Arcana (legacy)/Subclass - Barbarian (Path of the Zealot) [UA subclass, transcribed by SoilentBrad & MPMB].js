/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is made as an optional addition to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at http://bit.ly/MPMBCharTools
	You can add the content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding the script below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
